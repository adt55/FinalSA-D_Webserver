# FinalSA-D_Webserver
Final Project for Systems Analysis and Design. This is a mock inventory management site.
This involves a home page, a data entry page, and a page to input more information. 
The home page appears on your screen like this

under this tab you can choose to look at our list or add to the list under the addition page 

This is what the addition page looks like

then once you do that you can go look at the list page and see the addition you made, which looks like this

The site should be easy to use and understand!
